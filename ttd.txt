* client will have page for showing a carosel list of top performers (objects list) (pagenated)
* there will be a user account with a page for your account
* the performer object page will have all the metadata for the performer pulled out from
the url of the performer's page used to create the page
* there will be a voted tag column where custom tags are added and then voted on to label
the performer's traits (more votes = more significant trait)
*for all the adult cam sites there are, there will be a data file on the server that will be updated
that can parse the page for relevant data
*performers can eventually validate their page and add stuff to it if they wish?
*users can comment and stuff (customizable)

--Create model input page:
   For livejasmin, flirt4free and every cam site, we will extract the metadata selectors
   and put them in a collection in mongodb.  then we just have to add the site link in the
   input page.  after entering, it will load the html and use the saved selectors to 
   grab the text and place them in the db

    MetaData Field, pageURL,                dataXPath
    TwitterHandle,  livejasmin.com/abc.php  body/p/a

    This file will be defined and updated if need be.  Metadata for the model will be cached but
    everytime the show page is loaded, it dynamically reads the pages and parses for data again, updating the database with cached database


    The Add Show page will have fields like:
      LiveJasmin Show Page URL
      Streamate Bio url
      Other site page urls  (one field for each site metadata parsing file defined)
      <TagList> (eventually integrate knowshowgo tags)
      <Add Show Button>  (checks if this show has been added)


      Adding the show will parse the metadata, create the show entry in the db,






First, start with a simple version where we have a Performer page that has fields we can fill
in or are dynamically read in by parsing performer's page
That gets added to the model (database), and we can later add tags

*Pick the best performers we can find and add them into the database
*Sign up the affiliate account and have each performer's pics link to the affiliate link to their performer page
*Talk to the performers and see what other sites they may work through
*Maybe add a function to message or alert someone if the performer is going live

--BEST OF CAMS--
*Front page will first have my ordering of hottest from top left to bottom right and pagenated...
*then divided into categories
*then add tags and search by tags
*user can get emailed if criteria he likes shows up

first add my own tags to each performer...
then those tags will show up when the user creates and account and chooses tags in order
of importance that he will want to look at.
Then his front page will be ordered by what he chose
and when new performers with those tags are added they will appear and he will be alerted

Each performer can be rated in different ways.  people can rate down tags if they dont like it
We may want to create a review and links to the performers tube page, anything that we can monetize.


Then we upload our site to a web server and SEO it and market it any way we can (using dating sites, CL, email blasts,
 forums, camsite chatrooms ;)
